# Buhlean Operators ***Charged Up*** Repository

The Buhlean Operators code for the 2023 season - ***Charged Up***

Now with <ins>**Swerve Drive**</ins>!

Note that this is meant to be used with a drivetrain composed of four Swerve and Steer Modules by AndyMark, each configured with two SPARKS MAX, a NEO as the driving motor, a PG71 as the turning motor and a REV Through Bore Encoder as the absolute turning encoder.

To get started, make sure you have calibrated the zero offsets for the absolute encoders in the `REV Hardware Client` using the `Absolute Encoder` tab under the associated turning SPARK MAX devices.
