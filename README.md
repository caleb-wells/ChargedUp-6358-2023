# ChargedUp-6358-2023
The Buhlean Operators code for the 2023 season "Charged Up"
=======

*Note that this is meant to be used with a drivetrain composed of four MAXSwerve Modules, each configured with two SPARKS MAX, a NEO as the driving motor, a PG71 as the turning motor, and a REV Through Bore Encoder as the absolute turning encoder.

To get started, make sure you have calibrated the zero offsets for the absolute encoders in the Hardware Client using the `Absolute Encoder` tab under the associated turning SPARK MAX devices.

## Prerequisites
* SPARK MAX Firmware v1.6.1 - Adds features that are required for swerve
* REVLib v2023.1.1 - Includes APIs for the new firmware features
